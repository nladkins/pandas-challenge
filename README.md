## Background
  1. This script provides a number of outputs that help conduct an analysis of gaming sales data for the hypothetical free game "Heroes of Pymoli".
  2. The script provides inights into the purchase of optional items within the game that enhance their playing experience.
  3. Multiple outputs are printed that display summary data including analysis by age, gender, and top spenders.
  4. Additional analysis are also produced that analyze the items being sold including the most profitable and popular.
  5. Outputs are stored in a "Outputs" folder in a csv format.

## Outputs
  1. "Purchasing_Analysis.csv" including the overall number of unique items, average purchase price, total number of purchases, and total sales.
  2. "Age_Demographics.csv" including different age bins for minors and every five years up to the oldest player including count and percentages for each bin.
  3. "Age_Purchasing_Analysis.csv" analyzing the number of transactions, average purchase price, total sales, and average purchase by bin.
  4. "Gender_Demographics.csv" including percentage and count of each of the gender categories reported.
  5. "Gender_Purchasing_Analysis.csv" analyzing the number of transactions, average purchase price, total sales, and average purchase by reported gender.
  6. "Top_Spenders.csv" analyzing the number of customer numbers "SN" that identify the top spenders, the number of purchases made, average purchase, and total sales.
  7. "Most_Popular_Items.csv" analyzing the five most popular items by number of times each item was purchased including the item ID, name, price, and total sales.
  8. "Most_Profitable_Items.csv" analyzing the five most profitable items by total sales including the item ID, name, price, and total sales.

This script could be useful for performing similar analysis on sales data that is either structured similarly or require minor modifications to the script.
